# Embedded VS Code for NVIDIA Omniverse

This extension is the pair of the [*Embedded VS Code for NVIDIA Omniverse*](https://github.com/Toni-SM/semu.misc.vscode) extension for NVIDIA Omniverse applications that can be described as the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) version of Omniverse's [Script Editor](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/prod_extensions/prod_extensions/ext_script-editor.html). It allows to execute python code, embedded in a local/remote NVIDIA Omniverse application scope, from the VS Code editor and display the results in the OUTPUT panel (under *Embedded VS Code for NVIDIA Omniverse*) of the VS Code editor.

## Available commands

### Local execution

* **Embedded VS Code for NVIDIA Omniverse: Run** - Execute the python code from the active editor in the local configured NVIDIA Omniverse application and display the results in the OUTPUT panel

* **Embedded VS Code for NVIDIA Omniverse: Run Selected Text** - Execute the selected text in the active editor in the local configured NVIDIA Omniverse application and display the results in the OUTPUT panel

### Remote execution

* **Embedded VS Code for NVIDIA Omniverse: Run Remotely** - Execute the python code from the active editor in the remote configured NVIDIA Omniverse application and display the results in the OUTPUT panel

* **Embedded VS Code for NVIDIA Omniverse: Run Selected Text Remotely** - Execute the selected text in the active editor in the remote configured NVIDIA Omniverse application and display the results in the OUTPUT panel

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `remoteSocket.extensionIp`: IP address where the remote Omniverse application is running (default: `"127.0.0.1"`)
* `remoteSocket.extensionPort`: Port used by the *Embedded VS Code for NVIDIA Omniverse* extension in the remote Omniverse application (default: `8226`)
* `localSocket.extensionPort`: Port used by the *Embedded VS Code for NVIDIA Omniverse* extension in the local Omniverse application (default: `8226`)
* `output.clearBeforeRun`: Whether to clear the output before run the code. If unchecked (default value), the output will be appended to the existing content (default: `false`)
* `output.carbLogging`: Whether to enable carb logging to be displayed in the *Embedded VS Code for NVIDIA Omniverse (carb logging)* output panel. Changes will take effect after reloading the window (default: `true`)

## Limitations

- Print output will only be available in the VS Code OUTPUT panel after complete execution of the entire or selected code. Very large prints may not be displayed in the output panel

- Print output, inside callbacks (such as events), is not displayed in the VS Code OUTPUT panel but in the Omniverse application terminal. For that propose, use the following carb logging functions: `carb.log_info`, `carb.log_warn` or `carb.log_error`. If the carb logging is enabled, the output will be displayed in the *Embedded VS Code for NVIDIA Omniverse (carb logging)* output panel

- Carb log displaying is only available from Python calls. Logs generated by NVIDIA Omniverse applications/extensions implemented with another programming language (e.g. C/C++) are not displayed in the output panel

- The kit commands snippets (with their parameters, default values and annotations) are automatically generated from the list of commands available from Create, Code and Isaac Sim on Linux. Some commands may not be available in some Omniverse applications

## Release Notes

###  0.1.0

- Add Omniverse view container for commands, snippets and resources

### 0.0.3

- Fix duplicated carb log display due to local/remote socket issue

### 0.0.2

- Send carb logging Python calls to the VS Code extension

### 0.0.1
